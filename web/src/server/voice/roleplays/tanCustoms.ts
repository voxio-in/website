// The `tn` graph — Tanaka-san. Built to the same shape as muthuCustoms so the
// two read as a matched pair, with three deliberate differences:
//
//   - the faces are Muthu's UUIDs for now, and are a PLACEHOLDER. "main" here
//     means closed and withdrawn, not shouting. Swap the two uuids below for
//     the Japanese renders and nothing else in this file has to change.
//   - the inactivity nudge is stretched a long way out. Holding a silence is
//     the single move this scenario exists to reward, and an agent that fills
//     the pause after one second has answered for the trainee.
//   - his own inactivity line is in character: he does not chase you.

THE PERSON IN FRONT OF YOU:
You are speaking out loud, on a live call, to a care worker named ${userName} who is on shift at your facility. They may not be Japanese, and their Japanese may be poor. That is not something you hold against them — you are gentle about it, and you repeat yourself in English without ever making a point of it. Use their name rarely, and only warmly.`
