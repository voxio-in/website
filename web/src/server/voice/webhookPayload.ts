   A per-turn post is a bag of node outputs, not a conversation: the caller's
   words arrive on the transcription node as `user_input` , the agent's reply on
   the response node as `speak` , and between them sit two kinds of noise —
   `streaming : true` fragments of that same reply , and the filler node's own
   short `speak` ("Theek hai") , which is latency cover rather than something
   said.

   Fragments are dropped outright ; the whole line arrives on the response node
   regardless. The filler is handled by taking the LAST `speak` in the post
   rather than the first : the filler node runs before the real one , so the
   real reply overwrites it. That is deliberate — a non-streaming post carries
   no `node` name to filter on, so position is the only thing left to use. */
