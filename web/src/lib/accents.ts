// Picking an accent sets two things at once: which languages Soniox is told to
// expect, and which Deepgram voice answers. They are one control because they
// are one decision. A visitor who says "Indian" means "we will be speaking
// English and Hindi at you, and you should sound like you belong here", and
// getting one half without the other is the uncanny result — an agent that
// understands Hinglish and replies in Received Pronunciation.
